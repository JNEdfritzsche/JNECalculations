### Overview
Motor protection includes overload protection (thermal overloads) and short-circuit/ground-fault protection. Settings depend on motor FLA, service factor, and code requirements for the protection type.

### Typical equations
$$ I_{OL}=k\cdot I_{FLA}\quad\text{(overload setting)} $$
$$ I_{SC}=m\cdot I_{FLA}\quad\text{(short-circuit device sizing placeholder)} $$

### Flowchart placeholder
Use the inline flowchart below as a quick visual of the motor protection workflow. This is rendered directly from the markdown file using a flowchart marker.

After the flowchart, continue with any notes, examples, or decision details that you want to appear below the diagram.

### Notes
- Overload multipliers are commonly in the 1.15–1.25 range depending on motor and service factor.  
- Short-circuit device selection needs coordination with conductor ampacity and upstream devices.
