### Overview
Grounding and bonding conductor sizing is usually table-driven. NEC/OESC specify conductor sizes based on the largest ungrounded conductor or the OCPD rating. Consider electrode conductors (GEC), equipment grounding conductors (EGC), and bonding jumpers separately.

### Conceptual equation (placeholder)
$$ \text{EGC size} = f(\text{OCPD rating}) $$

### Practical notes
- Use the specific NEC/OESC tables for exact conductor sizes.  
- For transformer-secondary grounding or neutral grounding, follow transformer-specific rules and coordinate with protective devices.
