Tray fill and bend-radius rules depend on cable type, manufacturer recommendations, and local code rules. The following are geometric approximations to estimate area and bend radius.

$$ A_{cables}\approx n\cdot \pi\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 $$
$$ R_{min}=k\cdot d $$

### Notes
Real tray fill rules use percentage area limits and layering rules—replace these approximations with code tables for final designs.
