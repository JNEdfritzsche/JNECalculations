### Purpose
Transformer feeder design ensures conductors supplying the transformer can carry the expected load, meet continuous loading rules, and coordinate with overcurrent protection.

### Key points
- Start conductor sizing from transformer **secondary** full-load current.  
- Apply continuous load multipliers (e.g., 125% where applicable).  
- Adjust for ambient temperature, grouping, conductor insulation rating, and installation method.  
- Perform coordination with upstream protection and consider voltage drop and fault clearing.

### Equations
Secondary FLA (3Φ):

$$ I_{sec}=\frac{S}{\sqrt{3}\,V_{sec}} $$

Suggested continuous ampacity target (example):

$$ I_{target}=1.25\cdot I_{sec} $$

### Example

$$ I_{sec}=\frac{150{,}000}{\sqrt{3}\cdot 208}\approx 416\ \mathrm{A} $$
