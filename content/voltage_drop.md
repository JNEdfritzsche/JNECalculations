Use resistive or full impedance models; the resistive approximations shown below are quick checks.

Single-phase (2-wire) resistive estimate:
$$ \Delta V \approx 2\,I\,R\,L $$

Three-phase balanced resistive estimate:
$$ \Delta V \approx \sqrt{3}\,I\,R\,L $$

Percent voltage drop:
$$ \%\Delta V = 100\cdot\frac{\Delta V}{V_{nom}} $$

### Notes
For accurate results include conductor reactance, power factor, and tabulated conductor resistance/impedance per length.
